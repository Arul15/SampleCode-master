##SimpleDrillDown##

This application shows how to create a basic drill down interface.

The first scene shows a list of plays. When the user selects a play, the application displays a second scene that shows a list of the main characters and other data about the play. Both screens use a table view. The first list is in the "plain" style to show a standard list; the second is in the grouped style that you can use to lay out detail information.

The transition from the first scene to the second is defined by a segue associated with the prototype table view cell in the table view controller's table view. In the storyboard, the segue is named, "ShowSelectedPlay". The name is used as the idetifier in RootViewController's prepareForSegue:sender: method.

#pARk#

pARk is an application project that demonstrates a how to use Core Motion's true north-referenced attitude API. It contains a UIView subclass, ARView, that displays a live camera feed with places-of-interest overlaid at the appropriate coordinates. The places-of-interest used are some famous parks around the world.

Important Note: If you run the compiled application on a device that does not have a gyroscope, you cannot use device motion data. You cannot effectively run the application on the simulator. You have to test and debug applications on a device.

The project has the following classes and protocol, which (except where noted) have corresponding .h and .m file:

ARView â€”A UIView subclass that provides an augmented reality view of the specified places-of-interest. It uses AVFoundation to provide a live camera feed. It also uses Core Location to determine the user's location and Core Motion to determine where the user is facing (i.e. the user's attitude). When provided with an NSArray containing objects of type PlaceOfInterest, it computes the location of each place-of-interest relative to the user, and on every frame, it projects this onto the user's screen using the attitude provided by Core Motion. It then renders the UIView contained in each PlaceOfInterest at the projected location.

PlaceOfInterest â€”A class containing the data necessary to locate and render each place-of-interest (i.e. a UIView and a location).

pARkViewController â€”A view controller that feeds hard-coded places-of-interest to its ARView in viewDidLoad, starts the ARView in viewWillAppear, and stops the ARView in viewWillDisappear.

pARkAppDelegate â€”A standard implementation of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol.

See "Motion Events" in Event Handling Guide for iPhone OS explains how to use the Core Motion API. The document also includes links to related Core Motion reference documentation.

#AVCaptureAudioDataOutput To AudioUnit iOS#

AVCaptureToAudioUnit for iOS demonstrates how to use the CMSampleBufferRefs vended by AVFoundation's capture AVCaptureAudioDataOutput object with various CoreAudio APIs. The application uses a AVCaptureSession with a AVCaptureAudioDataOutput to capture audio from the default input, applies an effect to that audio using a simple delay effect AudioUnit and writes the modified audio to a file using the CoreAudio ExtAudioFile API. It also demonstrates using and AUGraph containing an AUConverter to convert the AVCaptureAudioDataOutput provided data format into a suitable format for the delay effect.

The CaptureSessionController class is responsible for setting up and running the AVCaptureSession and for passing the captured audio buffers to the CoreAudio AudioUnit and ExtAudioFile. The setupCaptureSession method is responsible for setting up the AVCaptureSession, while the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: passes the captured audio data through the AudioUnit via AudioUnitRender into the file using ExtAudioFileWriteAsync when recording.

CoreMedia provides two convenience methods to easily use the captured audio data with CoreAudio APIs. The CMSampleBufferGetAudioBufferListWithRetainedBlockBuffer API fills in an AudioBufferList with the data from the CMSampleBuffer, and returns a CMBlockBuffer which references (and manages the lifetime of) the data in that AudioBufferList. This AudioBufferList can be used directly by AudioUnits and other CoreAudio objects. The CMSampleBufferGetNumSamples API returns the number of frames of audio contained within the sample buffer, a value that can also be passed directly to CoreAudio APIs.

Because CoreAudio AudioUnits process audio data using a "pull" model, but the AVCaptureAudioDataOutput object "pushes" audio sample buffers onto a client in real time, the captured buffers must be sent though the AudioUnit via an AudioUnit render callback which requests input audio data each time AudioUnitRender is called to retrieve output audio data. Every time captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: receives a new sample buffer, it gets and stores the buffer as the Input AudioBufferList (so that the render callback can access it), and then immediately calls AudioUnitRender which synchronously pulls the stored input buffer list through the AudioUnit via the render callback. The output data is available in the output AudioBufferList passed to AudioUnitRender. This output buffer list may be passed to ExtAudioFile for final format conversion and writing to the file.

#iAdSuite#

iAdSuite is a set of samples demonstrating how to manage an ADBannerView in many common scenarios, each scenario demonstrated in a particular sample application.

In many of the samples the content is represented by a simple TextViewController view controller that displays some text in a read-only UITextView and runs a timer. The UITextView represents your application's content and the timer represents ongoing activity in your application that you will want to pause when the advertisement takes over the user interface. The MediumRectBanner sample uses a UICollectionView with image content instead, adding the banners as additional cells.

The traditional banner (represented with the ADAdTypeBanner constant) is expected to be placed at or near the bottom of the screen and placed to consume the full width of the screen. New in iOS 6 is the Medium Rect sized banner (represented with the ADAdTypeMediumRectangle constant) which is intended to be placed inline with other content from your application. It is highly recommended that you create only a single instance of each type of banner that you use (so if you use both a banner and medium rect type, you would have at most 1 instance of each) and that you share these instances among the places in your UI that they are used.

#PrintPhoto#

PrintPhoto demonstrates how to print photos. The application allows a user to view and print any photo from the user's photo library. It initially presents a photo that is built into the application's bundle but by touching the photo picker icon you can choose any photo in the library.

PrintPhoto demonstrates two different strategies for printing photos. The simplest way to print a photo is to set the printingItem property of the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance to the NSURL, NSData, UIImage, or ALAsset object referencing or containing the photo. If you have multiple photos to print, you can create an array containing the types of objects cited above and assign that array to the printingItems property.

PrintPhoto also demonstrates how to print by using a custom UIPrintPageRenderer object to render the content for printing. This object must be assigned to the printPageRenderer property of the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance. For this example, the subclass of UIPrintPageRenderer overrides the numberOfPages method as well as a "draw" method that draws the image upon request.

PrintPhoto also shows how to:

* Pick a photo from the user's photo library for display and print. * Utilize the ALAssetsLibrary to obtain a screen size image for display. * Obtain and configure the shared UIPrintInteractionController instance. * Use the printingItem property of the UIPrintInteractionController object for direct data submission. * Alternatively, use a UIPrintPageRenderer object to draw printable content instead of submitting it directly.

#PhotoLocations#

This sample illustrates a Core Data application that uses more than one entity and uses transformable attributes. It also shows inferred migration of the persistent store.

The application extends the completed project from the Core Data Tutorial for iPhone OS. The first screen displays a table view of events, which encapsulate a time stamp, a geographical location expressed in latitude and longitude, and the thumbnail of a picture for the event. The user can add and remove events using the first screen.

Event has an optional to-one relationship to Photo (which has an inverse to-one relationship back to Event) that contains the data for a full-sized image. By selecting a row on the first screen, the user displays a detail view that shows the photo (or allows the user to choose a photo for the event).

The photo data is not stored with the event object itself because it's not always needed. When the list of events is first displayed, only the thumbnails are shown. The events' photos are initially represented by faults. The full picture is required only if the user inspects the detail of an event. At the point at which the application asks for a given event's photo object, the fault fires and the photo object is retrieved automatically. This "lazy loading" of data means your application's memory consumption is kept as low as possible.

Although the application's data model is different from the original application's, the original data store is opened by specifying that inferred migration should be used in the application delegate's persistentStoreCoordinator method. (You must ensure that the applications' bundle identifiers are the same.)

#Large Image Downsizing#

This code sample demonstrates a way to support displaying very large images in limited memory environments by turning a large image on disk into a smaller image in memory. This is useful in situations where the original image is too large to fit into memory as required for it to be displayed.

Having useful implications in supporting user defined documents, it should be noted that the photo roll or document sharing drop are the locations that a large image would exist. For simplicity this sample reads a large image from the bundle.

Supported formats are: PNG, TIFF, JPEG. Unsupported formats: GIF, BMP, interlaced images.

#GLEssentials#

This sample provides examples of some essential techniques for using the OpenGL and OpenGL ES API. It includes usages of Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs), Vertex Array Objects (VAOs), Framebuffer Objects (FBO), and GLSL Program Objects. It creates a VAO and VBOs from model data loaded in. It then creates a texture for the model from image data and GLSL shaders from source also loaded in. Finally, it creates an FBO and texture to render a reflection of the model. It uses an environment mapping GLSL program to apply the reflection texture to a plane.

This sample also demonstrates sharing of OSX OpenGL with iOS OpenGL ES source code. Additionally, it demonstrates how to obtain and use an OpenGL 3.2 rendering context on OSX 10.7 or later.

Many of these techniques were described in the "OpenGL Essential Design Practices" session from WWDC 2010.

#AlternateViews#

Demonstrates how to implement alternate or distinguishing view controllers for each particular device orientation. Through the help of the following UIViewController properties, this can be easily achieved -

	@property(nonatomic,assign) UIModalTransitionStyle modalTransitionStyle;	// for a transition fade

	@property(nonatomic,assign) BOOL wantsFullScreenLayout; // for any view controller to appear over another

This sample implements a two different view controllers one for portrait and one for landscape. The portrait view controller listens for device orientations in order to properly swap in and out the landscape view controller. It uses the above two properties to achieve the visual cross-fade effect.

#Tweeting#

By using the Twitter framework, Accounts framework, and the NSJSONSerialization class, this sample demonstrates using the built-in Twitter composition sheet, creating a custom POST request, and downloading the public timeline from Twitter.

The "Send Easy Tweet" button checks if a Twitter account is present on the device and creates a pre-populated TWTweetComposeViewController. This also handles the "cancel" and "send" actions from the TWTweetComposeViewController.

The "Send Custom Tweet" button utilizes the Accounts framework to create an instance of the account store on the device and then find all Twitter accounts present. In this example, the first Twitter ACAccount object found is used to pre-populate a tweet and uses a TWRequest to post the tweet using the Twitter API. This example also handles the returned response data and http response.

The "Get Public Timeline" button creates a TWRequest to get the current public timeline using the Twitter API. The response data is then converted from JSON data to an NSDictionary, using the NSJSONSerialization class.

#ToolbarSearch#

This sample shows how to use a search field in a toolbar. When you start a search, a table view displaying recent searches matching the current search string is displayed in a popover.

The main view controller adds to a toolbar a bar button item with a search field as a custom view. If you tap the search field, the view controller presents a popover containing a list of recent searches. The list is stored in user defaults so that it persists between launches of the application, and is managed by the list's table view controller. The recents list is filtered by the current search term. If you select an item from the recents list, the item is copied to the search field and a search executed.

#SimpleGestureRecognizers#

This sample shows how to use standard gesture recognizers.

A view has four gesture recognizers to recognize a tap, a right swipe, a left swipe, and a rotation gesture. When they recognize a gesture, the recognizers send a suitable message to the view controller, which in turn displays an appropriate image at the location of the gesture.

The sample illustrates some additional features of gesture recognizers.

In general, there's no need to maintain a reference to a recognizer once you've added it to a view. You can simply implement the appropriate callback method for the recognizer and wait for messages. This is shown in the cases of the right swipe and rotation recognizers. In some situations, however, it may be appropriate to maintain a reference to the recognizer, so that you can for example determine which recognizer sent a delegate message. This is shown in the cases of the left swipe and tap recognizers.

For the purpose of illustration, the left swipe recognizer can be enabled and disabled by toggling a segmented control. The view controller maintains a reference to the recognizer so that it can be added to and removed from the view as appropriate.

The view controller acts as a delegate for the tap recognizer so that it can disallow recognition of a tap within the segmented control. Recognizers ignore the exclusive touch setting for views. This is so that they can consistently recognize gestures even if they cross other views. For example, suppose you had two buttons, each marked exclusive touch, and you added a pinch gesture recognizer to their superview. That a finger came down in one the of the buttons shouldn't prevent you from pinching in the general case. If you do want to selectively disallow recognition of a gesture, you can use the recognizer's delegate methods. In this example, the view controller uses gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: to test whether the tap recognizer will try to recognize a touch in the segmented control. If it is, it is disallowed.

A view controller creates four gesture recognizers to recognize a tap, a right swipe, a left swipe, and a rotation gesture. When they recognize a gesture, the recognizers send a suitable message to the view controller, which in turn displays an appropriate image at the location of the gesture.

#StopNGo for iOS#

StopNGo is a simple stop-motion animation QuickTime movie recorder that uses AVFoundation.

It creates a AVCaptureSession, AVCaptureDevice, AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer, and AVCaptureStillImageOutput to preview and capture still images from a video capture device, then re-times each sample buffer to a frame rate of 5 fps and writes frames to disk using AVAssetWriter.

A frame rate of 5 fps means that 5 still images will result in a 1 second long movie. This value is hard coded in the sample but may be changed as required.

#RosyWriter#

This sample demonstrates the use of the AV Foundation framework to capture, process, preview, and save video on iOS devices.

When RosyWriter launches, it creates an AVCaptureSession with audio and video device inputs, and outputs for audio and video data. These outputs continuously supply frames of audio and video to the app, via the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method.

The app applies a very simple processing step to each video frame. Specifically, it sets the green element of each pixel to zero, which gives the entire frame a purple tint. Audio frames are not processed.

After a frame of video is processed, RosyWriter uses OpenGL ES 2 to display it on the screen. This step uses the CVOpenGLESTextureCache API, new in iOS 5, for enhanced performance.

When the user chooses to record a movie, an AVAssetWriter is used to write the processed video and un-processed audio to a QuickTime movie file.

#iPhoneACFileConvertTest#

Demonstrates using the Audio Converter APIs to convert from a PCM audio format to a compressed format.

Four encoding formats may be chosen in the UI along with different sample rates for the produced output.caf file. AAC encoding using Audio Converter requires 4.1 or later and a hardware capable device such as the iPhone 3GS. If run on a device which does not support hardware assisted AAC encoding, the AAC encoding choice will be dimmed.

Interruption handling during processing is also demonstrated. Hardware assisted encoding requires specific interruption handling since the codec state may change due to the interruption.

All the relevant audio specific code is in the file AudioConverterFileConvert.cpp.

#aurioTouch#

aurioTouch demonstrates use of the remote i/o audio unit for handling audio input and output. The application can display the input audio in one of the forms, a regular time domain waveform, a frequency domain waveform (computed by performing a fast fourier transform on the incoming signal), and a sonogram view (a view displaying the frequency content of a signal over time, with the color signaling relative power, the y axis being frequency and the x as time).

The code in auriouTouch uses the remote i/o audio unit (AURemoteIO) for input and output of audio, and OpenGL for display of the input waveform. The application also uses Audio Session Services to manage route changes (as described in Core Audio Overview).

#PageControl#

This application primarily demonstrates use of UIScrollView's paging functionality to use horizontal scrolling as a mechanism for navigating between different pages of content. With the iPad, this type of user interface is not really necessary since the screen is larger allowing for more content and detailed information.

Designed as a universal application for both iPhone and iPad, this sample shows how to use two different sets of content, depending on which device the sample is running. The idea is that the iPhone uses a "smaller" set of images, while the iPad uses a "larger" set of images plus more detailed information.  As a universal app this sample shows how to factor out these two types of UI and data based on the device.

For the iPhone - The app uses UIScrollView and UIPageControl to move between pages. For the iPad - The app uses one large UIView with tiled pages, each page presenting a popover to display more detailed information.

Based on the UIDevice idiom type, the UIApplication delegate loads two different set of nib files, one for the iPhone and the other for the iPad.  To direct this kind of UI factoring, the sample uses a base class called "ContentController". Subclasses of ContentController are used to support each device. Hence, the app loads two different user interfaces (or xibs) as well as two different sets of data driven by the ContentController.

#TouchCells#

Demonstrates how to implement trackable-settable UIControls embedded in a UITableView. This approach is handy if an application already uses its accessory view to the right of the table cell, but still wants a check mark view that supports toggling states of individual row items. The green check mark on the left provides this need which is trackable (checked/unchecked) independent of table selection. This is a similar user interface to that of Mail's Inbox table where mail items can be individually checked and unchecked for deletion.

#DateSectionTitles#

This application shows how to create section information for NSFetchedResultsController using dates.

A single table view controller displays events sorted by date and grouped into sections by year and month. The Event entity has three attributes:

* timeStamp (persistent NSDate object).

The time stamp represents the time the event occurred.

* title (persistent NSString object).

The title of each event as it will be displayed on a row in the table view (this is not to be confused with section title). When the default data is created in the application delegate, the title is initialized to a string representation of the date.

* sectionIdentifier (transient NSString object).

The sectionIdentifier is used to divide the events into sections in the table view. It is a string value representing the number ((year * 1000) + month). Using this value, events can be correctly ordered chronologically regardless of the actual name of the month. It is calculated and cached on demand in the custom accessor method.

The sorting is all done at fetch time by the fetched results controller. The section name transformations are UI level and have no effect on the order of data.

#iPhoneMixerEQGraphTest#

iPhoneMixerEQGraphTest demonstrates how to build an Audio Unit Graph connecting a MultiChannel Mixer to the iPodEQ unit then to the RemoteIO unit.

Two input busses are created each with input volume controls. An overall mixer output volume control is also provided and each bus may be enabled or disabled. The iPodEQ may be enabled or disabled and a preset EQ curve may be chosen via a picker in the iPod Equalizer view. iPhoneMixerEQGraphTest uses 44.1kHz source and sets the hardware sample rate to 44.1kHz to avoid any extraneous sample rate conversions.

Touching the "Play Audio" button simply calls AUGraphStart while "Stop Audio" calls AUGraphStop. Changing AU volume is performed via AudioUnitSetParameter. The iPodEQ unit presets are returned by using AudioUnitGetProperty asking for the kAudioUnitProperty_FactoryPresets CFArrayRef. A current preset is then selected calling AudioUnitSetProperty using the kAudioUnitProperty_PresentPreset property and passing in the appropriate AUPreset. Note that the AU Host owns the returned CFArray and should release it when done.

Audio data is provided from two stereo audio files. The audio data is AAC compressed and ExtAudioFile is used to convert this data to the Core Audio Canonical uncompressed LPCM client format for input to the multichannel mixer.

All the relevant audio code is in the file AUGraphController.mm

The second example shows the time zones split into sections by region, with the region name as the section heading. It shows how to create an indexed table view.

The third example shows the time zones split into sections alphabetically, with the first letter of their locale name as the section heading. It shows how to set up a table view to display an index.

When implementing a table view cell, there's a tension between optimal scrolling performance and optimal edit/reordering performance. You should typically use subviews in the cell's content view.

When you have an edit or reordering control, using subviews makes the implementation easier, and the animations perform better because UIKit doesn't have to redraw during animations.

Subviews have two costs:

1) Initialization. This can be largely mitigated by reusing table cells. 2) Compositing. This can be largely mitigated by making the views opaque. Often, one translucent subview is fine, but more than one frequently causes frame drops while scrolling.

If the content is complex, however (more than about three subviews), scrolling performance may suffer. If this becomes a problem, you can instead draw directly in a subview of the table view cell's content view.

The fourth example displays more information about each time zone, such as the time and relative day in that time zone. Its main aim is to show how you can customize a table view cell using subviews. It also introduces custom classes to represent regions and time zones to help reduce the overhead of calculating the required information -- these are also used in the fifth example.

The fifth example is an extension of the fourth. It displays even more information about each time zone, such as the time and relative day in that time zone. Its shows how you can create a custom table view cell that contains a custom view that draws its content in -drawRect:.

#Scrolling#

Demonstrates how to implement two different style UIScrollViews. The first scroller contains multiple images, showing how to layout large content with multiple chunks of data (in our case 5 separate UIImageViews).

The second scroller simply displays one image, matching its contentSize to the image size. The app's primary UIViewController manages both scrollers. Refer to this sample for best practices in how to implement content with a single image or with multiple images.

#TheElements#

TheElements is a sample application that provides access to the data contained in the Periodic Table of the Elements. The Periodic Table of the Elements catalogs all the known atomic elements in the universe.

TheElements provides this data in multiple formats, allowing you to sort the data by name, atomic number, symbol name, and an element's physical state at room temperature.

TheElements is structured as a Model-View-Controller application. There is distinct separation of the model data, the views used to present that data, and the controllers which act as a liaison between the model and controller.

The application illustrates the following techniques: configuring and responding to selections in a tab bar, displaying information in a tableview using both plain and grouped style table views, using navigation controllers to navigate deeper into a data structure, subclassing UIView, providing a custom UITableViewCell consisting of multiple subviews, implementing the UITableViewDelegate protocol, implementing the UITableViewDataSource protocol, reacting to taps in views, open a URL to an external web site using Safari, flipping view content from front to back, and creating a reflection of a view in the interface.

#SimpleUndo#

The root view controller displays information (title, author, and copyright date) about a book. The user can edit this information by tapping Edit in the navigation bar. When editing starts, the root view controller creates an undo manager to record changes. The undo manager supports up to three levels of undo and redo. When the user taps Done, changes are considered to be committed and the undo manager is disposed of.

#Accessory#

Demonstrates how to implement a custom accessory view for your UITableView in the form of a checkmark button. It shows you how to override the appearance or control of the accessory view, much like that of "UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailDisclosureButton". It implements the custom accessory view by setting the table's "accessoryView" property with a UIButton of type "UIButtonTypeCustom". It can be toggled by selecting the entire table row by implementing UITableView's "didSelectRowAtIndexPath". The green checkmark is trackable (checked/unchecked), and can be toggled independent of table selection.

#DateCell#

Demonstrates formatted display of date objects in UITableViewCells and use of UIDatePicker to edit those values.

Using a grouped style UITableViewController, the sample has two UITableViewCells to draw the primary title and NSDate value. This is accomplished using the built-in cell type "UITableViewCellStyleValue1" which supports left and right text. In addition, this sample shows how to use NSDateFormatter class to achieve the custom cell's date-formatted appearance.

#TableSearch#

Demonstrates how to search the contents of a UITableView using UISearchBar and UISearchDisplayController, effectively filtering in and out the contents of that table. If an iPhone/iPod Touch application has large amounts of table data, this sample shows how to filter it down to a manageable amount if memory usage is a concern or you just want users to scroll through less table content.

#BonjourWeb#

This application illustrates the fundamentals of browsing for network services using Bonjour. The BonjourBrowser hierarchically displays Bonjour domains and services as table views in a navigation controller. The contents of the table views are discovered and updated dynamically using NSNetServiceBrowser objects. Tapping an item in the services table causes the corresponding NSNetService object to be resolved asynchronously. When that resolution completes, a delegate method is called which constructs a URL and opens it in Safari.
